## Homemade "Login by Face Recognition" Tutorial with fast.ai, Flask and React.

## The Big Picture.
In this step-by-step tutorial I show how to create a web application that recognizes your face. The model that does the heavy lifting (i.e. does the recognition, _the AI stuff_ ) is a  [fast.ai ](https://www.fast.ai/) model.
I have been  following their great course about Neural Networks since a while. Their 600-pages book covers a lot; it is full of **practical guidance** about training models. But the model's integration with a fullstack web application is not included in the course nor in their book (as far as I know). Therefore in this post I want:
- to show how to create a web application that _recognizes_ your face and lets you log in based on that. 
-  to show how to integrate a fast.ai model to a frontend framework. (React in this case)

The application's _relevant_ code is available on  [Github](https://github.com/PeterRusznak/login_by_face_recognition.git).  By relevant code I mean the exclusion of the trained model (which was trained to recognize _my_ face).

## Creating  Frontend

Create a new directory and open a terminal inside it and type ` npx create-react-app frontend` inside it. This will create a new react app with the name of _frontend_.  Enter it and launch the app by typing `npm start`. 

We need to install  [react-webcam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webcam). Type `npm install react-webcam`. Check `package.json` to see the installed version when the installation is ready. Every dependency of our frontend ( i.e. only dependencies installed with npm or yarn but not with pip, conda, etc..!) will appear here so this is the place where you can check the version and the fact of the installation.

Inside the `src` folder create a new component and name it `components/WebCamComp.js` Its content should be the following:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useRef, useCallback } from 'react';
import Webcam from 'react-webcam';

const WebcamCapture = (props) => {
    const webcamRef = useRef(null);
    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);
    let counter = 0;

    function savePicture(imageSrc, counter) {
        let link = document.createElement("a");
        document.body.appendChild(link);
        link.href = imageSrc;
        counter++;
        link.download = "screenshot" + counter + ".jpg";
        link.click();
        document.body.removeChild(link);
        return counter;
    }

    const capture = useCallback(() => {
        const imageSrc = webcamRef.current.getScreenshot();
        setImgSrc(imageSrc);
        counter = savePicture(imageSrc, counter);
    }, [webcamRef, setImgSrc]);
    return (
        <>
            <Webcam
                audio={false}
                ref={webcamRef}
                screenshotFormat="image/jpeg"
            />
            <button onClick={capture}>Capture photo</button>
            {imgSrc && (
                <img
                    src={imgSrc}
                />
            )}
        </>
    );
};

export default WebcamCapture;
```

This component uses the earlier installed `react-webcam` and some React Hooks. It creates and saves snapshots of your web camera. To get it working we also need to modify `App.js`. Replace its content with the followings:

```javascript
import WebCamComp from './components/WebCamComp'
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <WebCamComp />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

We can now launch the application by typing `npm start`.
Go to http://localhost:3000/.  On the left side of the screen you should see the webcam with a **Capture photo** button. By clicking on this button you create and save an image which displays what was on the webcam at the moment of the click. Go ahead and save a good 100 pictures of yourself. No kidding, we really need some pictures some pictures to train the model. Each should be a bit different from the others; turn left, right, tilt you head, close your eyes, make funny faces, etc...

## Creating Backend

At the same level where the `frontend` folder is located create a new folder and name it `backend`.
Enter it and create a Virtual Environment by typing `python3 -m venv venv`. 
Then activate it: `. venv/bin/activate`.

Install  [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)  and  [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) : `pip install flask python-dotenv`.

In the `backend` directory create two files `backend.py`  and `.flaskenv`
The content of backend.py should be (at least for now, we'll modify it later):
```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/picture', methods=['POST'])
def call_predict():

    req = request.get_json()
    imagestr = req.get('image')
    imagestr = imagestr.replace('data:image/jpeg;base64', '')

    print(imagestr)

    res = make_response({"message": "OK"}, 200)

    return res

```
The content of `.flaskenv` should be:
```
FLASK_APP=backend.py
FLASK_ENV=development
```
The command to start our backend server is `flask run`. It needs to be executed from the `backend` folder. Type `flask run`  and the result should be something like this:

```
 * Serving Flask app "backend.py" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 311-370-368
```


Bacause the backend runs on port:5000 we need a proxy to make things more convenient. Go to `frontend/package.json` and add the following line to the very end:
```
 "proxy": "http//localhost:5000"
```
It should look like this:

![proxy.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1614081911449/gEsFXBxUk.png)

To call our backend we need to modify WebCamComp.js. Let's add a function that actually calls our backend.
```javascript
import React, { useState, useRef, useCallback } from 'react';
import Webcam from 'react-webcam';

const WebcamCapture = (props) => {
    const webcamRef = useRef(null);
    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);
    let counter = 0;
  
    function callBackend(imageSrc, props) {
        let entry = {
            image: imageSrc
        };
        fetch(`${window.origin}/picture`, {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify(entry),
            cache: "no-cache",
            headers: new Headers({
                "content-type": "application/json"
            })
        }).then(response => {
            console.log(response);
            if (response.status === 200) {
                props.history.push('/ok');
            } else if (response.status === 403) {
                props.history.push('/not_ok');
            }
        });
    }    
    function savePicture(imageSrc, counter) {
        let link = document.createElement("a");
        document.body.appendChild(link);
        link.href = imageSrc;
        counter++;
        link.download = "screenshot" + counter + ".jpg";
        link.click();
        document.body.removeChild(link);
        return counter;
    }
    const capture = useCallback(() => {
        const imageSrc = webcamRef.current.getScreenshot();
        setImgSrc(imageSrc);
        callBackend(imageSrc, props);
        counter = savePicture(imageSrc, counter);
    }, [webcamRef, setImgSrc]);
    return (
        <>
            <Webcam
                audio={false}
                ref={webcamRef}
                screenshotFormat="image/jpeg"
            />
            <button onClick={capture}>Capture photo</button>
            {imgSrc && (
                <img
                    src={imgSrc}
                />
            )}
        </>
    );
};
export default WebcamCapture;

```

Now you can restart the application and click _Capture photo_. The image will be converted to base64 String and this string will be printed to backend's terminal. 
![base.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1614091194097/uG_iwpjwy.png)

This way we can make sure that the connection between frontend and backend is working. Clicking the button will also break the (frontend) application, but no worries, it's just temporary.

## Integrating fast.ai
### Creating the Model
I am not going to write long about creating the model  [because Jeremy and Sylvain have done it](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) much better than I ever could. I decided to use  [google's colab.](https://colab.research.google.com/)  Below is my notebook:
```
!pip install -Uqq fastbook
import fastbook
fastbook.setup_book()
from fastbook import *
from fastai.vision.widgets import *
```
After the necessary imports I created two folders named `me` and `not_me`  and filled them with images  shot with this application.
```
types = 'me','not_me'
path = Path('people')
if not path.exists():
    path.mkdir()
```
I checked the quality of the uploaded images:
```
fns = get_image_files(path)
failed = verify_images(fns)
```
and created datablock and dataloaders:
```
people = DataBlock(
blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
get_items=get_image_files, 
splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
get_y=parent_label,
item_tfms=Resize(128))

dls =people.dataloaders(path)
```
I did some data augmentation:
```
people = people.new(
    item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.5),
    batch_tfms=aug_transforms())
dls = people.dataloaders(path)
```

and I settled down the usage of Resnet50 and fine tuning for 5 epochs. (From around the sixth-seventh epoch the results started to deteriorate)
```
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet50, metrics=error_rate)
learn.fine_tune(5)
```
The results are below:

![results.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1614098422934/gbWTUjO-j.png)

The confusion matrix looked acceptable so I exported and downloaded the model.

### Importing the model
I put the downloaded model into the backend folder.
We need to install fastai, type: `pip install fastai`.

**ATTENTION** fast.ai comes with PyTorch and PyTorch needs a lot of free RAM and if your Virtual Environment does not have enough, it will present a very frustrating error:
```
Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/31/a4/c10f07959fd58ffd066518e3f163f55d40bc033191184a8903e660d88c03/pandas-1.2.2-cp38-cp38-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
Collecting torch<1.8,>=1.7.0 (from fastai)
Killed
```

If everything is OK, change the content of backend.py to the following:
```
from flask import Flask, request, make_response
import base64
from fastai import *
from fastai.vision.all import *

app = Flask(__name__)
path = Path()
learn_inf = load_learner(path/'export.pkl')


@app.route('/picture', methods=['POST'])
def call_predict():
    req = request.get_json()
    imagestr = req.get('image')
    imagestr = imagestr.replace('data:image/jpeg;base64', '')
    image = base64.b64decode(str(imagestr))
    pili_img = PILImage.create(io.BytesIO(image))

    pred, pred_idx, probs = learn_inf.predict(pili_img)
    print("pred")
    print(pred)
    print(probs)
    if pred == "me":
        res = make_response({"message": "OK"}, 200)
    else:
        res = make_response({"message": "Unrecognized"}, 403)
    return res

``` 
Our updated backend now imports the exported model when the server starts. When `call_predict()` gets called by the frontend, it converts a base64 string to an image and forwards this image to the model instance to make a prediction. We log the prediction and create and return response based on it.

## Finishing touches

Let's create two components, `OkComponent.js` which will be displayed if the model recognized me, and `NotOkComponent.js` which will be displayed otherwise. Both should be located inside frontend's components folder. Their content is basic: 

```javascript
import React from 'react'
const OkComponent = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Recognized. Welcome here</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
export default OkComponent
```

```javascript
import React from 'react'
const NotOkComponent = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Sorry, you are not being recognized</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
export default NotOkComponent
```
In order to use them we need Routing. Stop the frontend server and type:
`npm install react-router-dom`.

Then replace `App.js` with the code below which utilizes Routing:
```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import WebCamComp from './components/WebCamComp';
import OkComponent from './components/OkComponent';
import NotOkComponent from './components/NotOkComponent';
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div className="App">
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/" exact component={WebCamComp}></Route>
          <Route path="/ok" component={OkComponent}></Route>
          <Route path="/not_ok" component={NotOkComponent}></Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
export default App;
```

That's it. Done. Restart the application, and you'll be recognized and forwarded to `OkComponent` assuming you trained your model well. Congrats, you made it till the end and now you know how to integrate fast.ai with a web application.
