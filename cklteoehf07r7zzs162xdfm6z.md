## The Bear Classifier (fast.ai meets Angular)


## The Big Picture

This is a step-by-step tutorial about integrating fast.ai's famous _Bear-classifier_ (a Neural Network model trained to do image recognition) with Angular.

[Last time](https://fullstackwithpr.hashnode.dev/homemade-login-by-face-recognition-tutorial-with-fastai-flask-and-react) we called another trained fast.ai model from a web environment and now we do this again. But this tutorial is for those who prefer **Angular** over React. 

Here is the demo:

In this tutorial I confine myself to the integration of an already trained model (i.e  I won't write about the training of the model which is already covered in great details by Jeremy and Sylvain). The application's _relevant_ code is available on  [Github](https://github.com/PeterRusznak/bear_classifier).  By relevant code I mean the exclusion of the trained model (which is quite large and you can easily train it yourself by following the  [book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).)

## Creating Backend

Create a new folder and name it `backend`. Enter it and create a Virtual Environment by typing `python3 -m venv venv`.  Then activate it: `. venv/bin/activate`.

We need to install some dependencies. Install  [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)  and  [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)  and  [flask-cors](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Cors/) : `pip install flask python-dotenv flask-cors`.

Also install fast.ai with `pip install fastai`. 

 **Attention! ** Fastai comes with PyTorch and PyTorch needs a lot of free RAM and if your Virtual Environment does not have enough, it will present a very frustrating error:

Collecting torch<1.8,>=1.7.0 (from fastai)
Killed
```
Put the trained model  (which is in my case called `export.pkl`) to the backend folder.
Also create here (in the backend folder) two other files and call them `backend.py`  and `.flaskenv`. The content of `.flaskenv` should be:
```
FLASK_APP=backend.py
FLASK_ENV=development
```
The content of backend.py should be the following:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, make_response
from flask_cors import CORS

from fastai import *
from fastai.vision.all import *

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

path = Path()
learn_inf = load_learner(path/'export.pkl')


@app.route('/api/image-upload', methods=['POST'])
def call_predict():

    imageFile = request.files['imageFile']
    pili_img = PILImage.create(imageFile)
    pred, pred_idx, probs = learn_inf.predict(pili_img)
    prediction = str(pred) + ", "+str(probs)
    print(prediction)

    resp = make_response({"prediction": prediction}, 200)
    return resp


```

In the `call_predict` function we create an endpoint which accepts the uploaded files (images). Inside the function the model makes the prediction. The function returns a response.

The command to start our backend server is `flask run`. It needs to be executed from the `backend` folder. Type `flask run`  and the result should be something like this:

```
 * Serving Flask app "backend.py" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 311-370-368
```
As we can see the server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. We need to remember this, because our frontend client will use it. 

## Creating Frontend

Make sure angular is installed. Type `ng --version`. If yes,  type `ng new frontend` to create a new angular project (the word _frontend_  relates to the name of the project, can be something else, if you prefer so). The installation will ask some questions about routing and css. In this tutorial it does not matter how you answer them.
Enter the `frontend` folder when the intallation is done and type `ng serve --open`. Now the project runs on http://localhost:4200/ 

First we need a service, type: `ng generate service services/Image`
That will generate a new `image.service.ts` file in the `src/app/services` folder. Replace its content with the following:
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

import { Prediction } from "./Prediction";

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ImageService {

  constructor(private http_client: HttpClient) { }

  url: string = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/image-upload";

  uploadImage(imageFile: File): Observable<Prediction> {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('imageFile', imageFile);
    return this.http_client.post<Prediction>(this.url, formData);
  }
}
```
Here we specify the address of our backend in the _url_ variable. 
Note that it basically contains two parts: the first part `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` is the address where our flask server runs; the second part `/api/image-upload` is the content of the annotation of our `backend.py` file. The most interesting part of the file is the `uploadImage()` function. It calls our endpoint (note: it uses post which corresponds the annotation of the `backend.py`) with the uploaded picture and returns a `Prediction` object (which we'll create soon). But first we need some imports. Go to  `app.module.ts` and add `HttpClientModule` like this:

![http_client.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1614767297406/vee9qrHmr.png)

Now create a `Prediction.ts` file  in the `services` folder with the following content:
```typescript
export class Prediction {
    prediction!: string;
}
```
We also need a new component. Type `ng generate component components/Image` 
To import this newly created component we need to remove everything from `src/app/app.component.html` and put the following there:
```html
<div>
  <h1>{{ name | uppercase }}</h1>
  <app-image></app-image>
</div>
```
`<app-image></app-image>` refers to the `selector` value inside  `src/app/components/image/image.component.ts`

Add the name variable to `src/app/app.component.ts` like this:
![ts_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1614768910460/taKcBPpYM.png)

Now if you launch the application you'll see the default message of the image component. 
To see a more meaningful page change the `src/app/components/image/image.component.html` file content as follows: 

```html
<div>
    <label class="image-upload-container btn btn-bwm">
        <span>
            Select Image
        </span>
        <input #imageInput type="file" accept="image/*" (change)="processFile(imageInput)">
    </label>
    <div>
        <img [src]="imageUrl" *ngIf="imageUrl">
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1> {{prediction}}</h1>
    </div>
</div>
```
`imageInput` is the FileUploader widget. `(change)` will trigger a call. At the end of this call the prediction will be displayed onscreen along with the uploaded picture.
The  content of `src/app/components/image/image.component.ts` needs to be changed, too:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ImageService } from '../../services/image.service';

class ImageSnippet {
  constructor(public src: string, public file: File) { }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-image',
  templateUrl: './image.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./image.component.css']
})
export class ImageComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private imageService: ImageService) { }

  prediction!: String;
  imagePath!: File;
  imageUrl!: any;
  ngOnInit(): void {
  }

  processFile(imageInput: any) {
    const file: File = imageInput.files[0];
    const reader = new FileReader();

    reader.addEventListener('load', (event: any) => {

      let selectedFile = new ImageSnippet(event.target.result, file);
      this.imageService.uploadImage(selectedFile.file).subscribe(
        (response) => {
          this.prediction = response.prediction;
        },
        (err) => {
          console.log(err)
        })
    });
    this.imagePath = imageInput;
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
    reader.onload = (_event) => {
      this.imageUrl = reader.result;
    }
  }
}
```

The function called `processFile` is the most interesting. It gets the file from the uploading widget and basically forwards it to the service. Since it's asynchronous call, we need to subscribe. When the response (which is a `src/app/services/Prediction.ts` object) is ready, we assign the`prediction` property  of the response to the `prediction` variable of this file. The value will be displayed on the html file, because of:

![pred.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1614771188996/nTMtWKsoP.png)

The last couple of lines of `processFile` are responsible of displaying the uploaded image, too. 

That's it. Although in this tutorial I showed the integration of the Hello World-like Bear Classifier model, but now you know how to integrate **any** fast.ai model with Angular. Congrats!
