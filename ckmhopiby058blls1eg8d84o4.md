## Scribble on Canvas and sell it as NFT (React, Truffle, IPFS, OpenSea)

## The Big Picture

NFT-s are all over the news, that's why I decided to write a step-by-step tutorial which shows how to make and deploy one. My idea is to create a React Canvas component where  _artists_ (whoever who feels their artistic vein) can scribble whatever they wish and save the resulting image on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). Based on this image we _mint_ (create) an NFT and make it available on OpenSea.

Here is a short demo:

The full code is available on  [Github](https://github.com/PeterRusznak/scribble_nft) .

### Software Versions
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
- node: v14.15.4
- npm: 6.14.10
- Truffle: v5.1.59 

##  Creating and deploying the smart contract

There is nothing new here. As usual, execute the following command: `npx create-react-app nft` to create   [React](https://reactjs.org/)  frontend application with the name of `nft`. We'll use  [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) to compile and deploy our contract, so enter the `nft` folder and type `truffle init`.  This gives us everything we need to work with smart contracts. 

The structure of the project should be similar to this:

![truffle_structure.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616414525505/6pdtwlPTq.png)
- The folder `contract` is the place for well, contracts. `Migration.sol` is automatically generated by Truffle
- The folder `migrations` is for deployment-scripts.
- The folder `abis` is the place where the Json files generated based on the contracts are.
This folder and its content appear only after `truffle compile`.
- The file `truffle-config.js` is  where we can configure truffle. 

We will need a bunch of dependencies later: 

```javascript
  "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^3.4.1",
  "babel-polyfill": "^6.26.0",
  "babel-register": "^6.26.0",
  "ipfs-api": "^26.1.2",
  "ipfs-http-client": "^49.0.4",
  "react-canvas-draw": "^1.1.1",
  "truffle": "^5.2.3",
  "truffle-hdwallet-provider": "^1.0.17",
  "web3": "^1.3.4"
```

so add them to `package.json` and hit `npm install`. After that you can replace the content of `truffle-config.js` with the following:

```javascript
require('babel-register');
require('babel-polyfill');
var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");

const mnemonic = "apple orange banana.... here comes your Metamask mnemonic ";
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
    rinkeby: {
      provider: function () {
        return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/HERE_COMES_INFURA_PROJECT_ID");
      },
      network_id: 4,
    }
  },
  contracts_build_directory: './src/abis/',
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.6.6",
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200
      }
    }
  }
}
```
 [Infura](https://infura.io/)  enables anyone to use the Ethereum Network and IPFS without installing and maintaining an Ethereum and/or IPFS nodes. Register on their website and create a project like this:

![infura.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1615375824338/W4WJKa-MY.png)

You'll also need you Metamask- mnemonic. If you are like me and have already forgotten them long time ago here is where you can find them:

Now it's time to create a contract. Create a file named `DrawingCollectible.sol` inside the `contracts` folder with the following content:
```
pragma solidity 0.6.6;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract DrawingCollectible is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 public tokenCounter;

    constructor() public ERC721("Drawing", "DRW") {
        tokenCounter = 0;
    }

    function createCollectible(string memory tokenURI)
        public
        onlyOwner
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 newItemId = tokenCounter;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);
        tokenCounter = tokenCounter + 1;
        return newItemId;
    }
}
```

A couple of things here: in order to make our contract to comply with the NFT standards it needs to implement OpenZeppelin's  [ERC271](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC721) implementation. The constructor takes two arguments: the first one is the _name_, the second one is the _symbol_. These values are visible on OpenSea, Metamask, etc.

![symbol.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616235235598/jXPrr17uC.png)

The _minting_ (i.e. the creation) of a Non Fungible Token takes place in the `createCollectible` function. To make sure that only the owner can mint NFT-s this function uses the `onlyOwner` modifier from OpenZeppelin's Ownable implementation. We will call `createCollectible` from our React application and we will supply it a URI which points to a json object. 

The contract is ready. Compile it with `truffle compile`.
To deploy it we need a new file called `2_deploy_contract.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const DrawingCollectible = artifacts.require("DrawingCollectible");

module.exports = function (deployer, network, accounts) {
    deployer.deploy(DrawingCollectible, { from: accounts[0] });
};
```

We can now deploy the contract running the 
`truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby` command.

## Creating the Frontend

We use the  [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/)  library to interact with the blockchain. 
In App.js  I use the standard `loadWeb3` 

```javascript
  const loadWeb3 = async () => {
    if (window.ethereum) {
      window.web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum)
      await window.ethereum.enable()
    }
    else if (window.web3) {
      window.web3 = new Web3(window.web3.currentProvider)
    }
    else {
      window.alert('Non-Ethereum browser detected. You should consider trying MetaMask!')
    }
  };
```
We need an _abi_ and an address to interact with any smart contract:
```javascript
 const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(DrawingCollectible.abi, contract_address);
```
This is included in the`loadBlockChainData()` function. The function also contains a check for the correct network (Rinkeby in this case) and setting the relevant `useState` hooks (deployedContract, account, balance, name, symbol). Below is the full function:

```javascript
const loadBlockchainData = async () => {
    const web3 = window.web3
    const networkId = await web3.eth.net.getId()
    if (networkId !== 4) {
      window.alert('Please switch network to the Rinkeby and refresh the page')
    }
    const networkData = DrawingCollectible.networks[networkId];
    if (networkData) {
      const contract_address = networkData.address;
      const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(DrawingCollectible.abi, contract_address);
      setDeployedContract(contract);
      const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
      setAccount(accounts[0])
      const bal = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]);
      setBalance(bal);
      contract.methods.name().call(function (err, res) {
        setName(res)
      });
      contract.methods.symbol().call(function (err, res) {
        setSymbol(res)
      });
    } else {
      alert("Wrong NETWORK")
    }
  }
```
functions to connect to the deployed Contract. I call these functions from `useEffect` which is just a modern way to say componentDidMount(). It runs only once when the component gets created. 

```javascript
 useEffect(() => {
    const load = async () => {
      await loadWeb3()
      await loadBlockchainData()
    }
    load();
  }, []);
```

## Uploading to IPFS

We upload files to IPFS not once but twice. First the image, than the metadata based on the image. I'll explain it momentarily. But let's just create the canvas first.
Create another component and name it `CanvasComponent.js`. Here I use the  [CanvasDraw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-canvas-draw)  library.
```javascript
import CanvasDraw from "react-canvas-draw";
```
The component has a button below the canvas. This button calls a function where we convert the canvas' content to an Uint8Array. 

```javascript
 let canvas = canvasRef.current.canvasContainer.children[1];
 let dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL("image/png");
 const buffer = Buffer(dataUrl.split(",")[1], 'base64');
```
We need to do this because Uint8Array is the format that IPFS accepts:
![uintarray.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616236944537/nkT-jvSA5.png)
Now we can make the image upload:
```javascript
ipfs.files.add(buffer, (error, result) => {
     if (result) {
           //her we need to create the metadata json.
     }
     if (error) {
         console.log(error)
     }
```

The `result` here will be a hash. Append this hash to the end of http://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/ URI and we get the URI of the uploaded image:
https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmY8vF9PxemEytzqh6Jo5BqCWPEVd5BKH8ZaGXMjVYPSTo

Storing large data on blockchain is cost-prohibitive. In fact, in order to save on gas fees, we would like to store as little data on blockchain as possible. This is where off-chain metadata comes in to play. We need a metadata file that complies with the [ metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards).

In our case it's a javascript object like this:

```javascript
let metadata = {
    "name": "Here comes the name",
    "description": "no need for this",
    "image": "image",
    "attributes": []
}```

So when the result from the first IPFS upload is in we modify the metadata to contain the URI of the image:

```javascript
  metadata.image = INFURA_HTTPS + result[0].hash;
```
and once again call `ipfs.files.add` this time with the content of metaadata:
```javascript
 let metadataBuffer = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(metadata));
 ipfs.files.add(metadataBuffer, (error, secondResult) => {
    if (secondResult) {
        ....
    }
```
The result well be a hash again. We need to create another valid URI from this hash. This URI will be the `tokenURI' that our contract accepts.:
```javascript
 const tokenURI = INFURA_HTTPS + secondResult[0].hash;
 deployedContract.methods.createCollectible(tokenURI).send({ from: account }).on('transactionHash', 
        (hash) => {
               console.log("success, transction hash: ", hash);
        })
```
That's it. 
Below is the full code of CanvasComponent.js
```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import CanvasDraw from "react-canvas-draw";
import metadata from './metadata.js'

//Declare IPFS
//const ipfsClient = require('ipfs-http-client')
//const ipfs = ipfsClient({ host: 'ipfs.infura.io', port: 5001, protocol: 'https' })

const ipfsAPI = require('ipfs-api')
const ipfs = ipfsAPI('ipfs.infura.io', '5001', { protocol: 'https' })

const INFURA_HTTPS = "https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/";
const WIDTH = 600;
const HEIGHT = 400;

const CanvasComponent = ({ deployedContract, account }) => {
    const canvasRef = useRef();
    const download = () => {
        let canvas = canvasRef.current.canvasContainer.children[1];
        let dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL("image/png");
        const buffer = Buffer(dataUrl.split(",")[1], 'base64');
        console.log(buffer)
        ipfs.files.add(buffer, (error, result) => {
            if (result) {
                metadata.image = INFURA_HTTPS + result[0].hash;
                console.log("image uploaded to IPFS image URI:" + metadata.image)
                console.log(metadata)
                let metadataBuffer = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(metadata));
                ipfs.files.add(metadataBuffer, (error, secondResult) => {
                    if (secondResult) {
                        const tokenURI = INFURA_HTTPS + secondResult[0].hash;
                        console.log("Metadata uploaded to IPFS image as JSON URI:" + tokenURI)
                        deployedContract.methods.createCollectible(tokenURI).send({ from: account }).on('transactionHash', (hash) => {
                            console.log("success, transction hash: ", hash);
                        })
                    }
                    if (error) {
                        console.log(error)
                    }
                })
            }
            if (error) {
                console.log(error)
            }
        })
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <CanvasDraw
                canvasWidth={WIDTH}
                canvasHeight={HEIGHT}
                ref={canvasRef}
            />
            <button
                onClick={download}
                className="button">
                Download
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default CanvasComponent
```      

Basically that's it. I left out minor details but you can get the full project on [Github](https://github.com/PeterRusznak/scribble_nft). Start the npm server and go to http://localhost:3000/
Give room to your artistic vein and hit "Download". Then go to OpenSea. Make sure you are on the Rinkeby Test Network.
