## Unhackable CRUD Application Tutorial. Ditch the complete legacy IT Stack with Dfinity's Internet Computer

## The Big Picture

In this step-by-step tutorial I create a simple CRUD Application,which is a very simple Customer Management System. I strongly believe that the underlying technology is truly remarkable. 
Dfinity's  [Internet Computer](https://dfinity.org/) is the next step of blockchain evolution. This Switzerland-based non-profit organization promises nothing less than the complete redesign of the entire internet and the way how developers write and deploy software. It's worth repeating: they promise us a blockchain-based public network that can be used as a 
### **complete replacement for today’s legacy IT stack**
including Big Tech’s cloud services, and legacy infrastructure software such as file systems, web servers, middleware, and databases. No more databases. No more firewalls. The Internet Computer’s serverless architecture allows the internet to natively host software and services, eliminating — claims Dfinity — the need for proprietary cloud services. Therefore no more third-party cloud providers like AWS or Google Cloud. No more virtual monopolies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and WhatsApp. And no more  [platform risk](https://blog.simeonov.com/2013/03/05/platform-risk-anti-pattern/). 

But, one might object, blockchain is so slow and expensive... However Internet Computer runs at web's speed. It also has unbounded capacity. Visitors of the page don't need to install Metamask or any other wallet. They can access the application the same way as any other website (i.e. there is no gas fee for them). And  because the application is based on blockchain it is tamper-proof and unhackable by design.

Too good to be true? We shall see. I definitely root for them. 

This tutorial's code is available on [Github](https://github.com/PeterRusznak/Internet_Computer_CRUD_example).
Special thanks to **enzoh** whose [repository](https://github.com/enzoh/superheroes) was quite helpful when I did my baby steps on the rough terrain of [motoko](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html).  

## Software versions

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
- node: v14.15.4
- npm: 6.14.10
- dfx: 0.6.26 !!! **Make sure that you are using this version for this tutorial** !!!

## Installing dfx

`dfx` is the command line tool to intereact with Internet Computer.
Create a variable like below. Use the same version because anything beyond `0.7.0-beta` requires different approch!
```
export DFX_VERSION=0.6.26
```
Run the following script to download dfx.

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
``` 

if it is done, check the installed version:
```
dfx --version
```
It should be `0.6.26`


## Creating Canisters

Canister is a software unit that contains both code and state. Under the hood of a canister, there is smart contract logic in the form of WebAssembly byte code. The reason canisters are called “canisters” rather than “smart contracts” is that they are in fact bundles of code and state. State is persisted naturally by the system therefore no need of databases and you just declare a datastructure as you need it. Internet Computer implements _orthogonal persistence_ —an old idea where a program has the illusion of running “forever” and its memory staying alive (at least until it is explicitly taken down). This means that developers do not have to worry about explicitly saving their data or bother with files or an external database: whatever values or data structures are stored in program variables will still be there when the next message arrives, even if that is months later. 

Let's create a new project. Open a terminal and type:
```
 dfx new crud
 ```
Enter the freshly created `crud` directory (our root directory) and start the network there:
```
dfx start --clean
```
Open another terminal also in the `crud` directory and create the canisters:
```
dfx canister create --all
```
This creates two canisters, one with the name of `crud` and another with the name of `crud_assets`.

Build the canisters:
```
dfx build
```
and install them:
```
dfx canister install --all
```
The generated canister id-s are located in `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`.
Copy the canister id for `crud_assets`.  For me it is `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai`. You can access the application using the assets' canister id in any browser like this:
```
 http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
``` 
The application's generated code greets you with a popup. Try it out.

## Using React

Let's _reactify_ the frontend. Append the list of `devDependencies` with `css-loader` and add `dependencies` to `package.json` like below:

```json
 "devDependencies": {
    ...
    "css-loader": "^5.2.4"
 },
"dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^4.6.0",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-bootstrap": "^1.5.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0",
    "style-loader": "^2.0.0",
    "ts-loader": "^8.1.0",
    "typescript": "^4.2.3"
  }
```
Run `npm install` to install everything we need. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory with the following content:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es2018", /* Specify ECMAScript target version: 'ES3' (default), 'ES5', 'ES2015', 'ES2016', 'ES2017', 'ES2018', 'ES2019' or 'ESNEXT'. */
        "module": "commonjs", /* Specify module code generation: 'none', 'commonjs', 'amd', 'system', 'umd', 'es2015', or 'ESNext'. */
        "lib": [
            "ES2018",
            "DOM"
        ], /* Specify library files to be included in the compilation. */
        "allowJs": true, /* Allow javascript files to be compiled. */
        "jsx": "react", /* Specify JSX code generation: 'preserve', 'react-native', or 'react'. */
        "esModuleInterop": true
    },
    "include": [
        "src/**/*"
    ],
}
```

 Add the `module` to the end of `webpack.config.js` file, above ` plugins: [],`:
 
```js
    module: {
      rules: [
        { test: /\.(js|ts)x?$/, loader: "ts-loader" },
        {
          test: /\.css$/,
          loader: 'style-loader!css-loader'
        },
        {
          test: /\.(png|jpg|gif|svg|eot|ttf|woff|woff2)$/,
          loader: 'url-loader',
          options: {
            limit: 10000
          }
        }
      ]
    },
```
Change `index.js` to `index.jsx` in `dfx.json` like this:
![dfx_jsx.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619594761459/uS6YBh1CR.png)

Rename the actual file itself to `src/crud_assets/public/index.jsx`. Replace the content of `index.jsx`
with the following:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```
In the same directory where `index.jsx` is, create another file with the name of `App.js`. The content should be the following:
```
import React from 'react';
const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            React, Bootstrap WORKS in crud_assets canister.
        </div>
    );
}
export default App
```
Rebuild the application with `dfx build`. Reinstall the application with the `--mode reinstall` flag:
```
dfx canister install --all --mode reinstall
```
The result should be like this in your browser:

![react_bootstrap_works.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619595908857/PfBJI0lX9.png)

## Adding Create and Read functionality
### Backend

First, let's modify the `crud` canister in `src/crud/main.mo`. This is our backend and our _database_ (i.e. the place where we persist data in the form of datastructures like Arrays or Tries). The language here is [motoko](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/08/24/motoko-the-language-that-turns-the-web-into-a-computer/), a semicolon-and-curly-braces language, wich was tailor-made for Internet Computer. The language's creators say _Motoko has been designed to be intuitive to those familiar with Javascript and other popular languages, but offers modern features such as sound structural types, generics, variant types, and checked pattern matching._ I for one believe them on this, I _know_ javascript and motoko is _somewhat_ intuitive to me. However, this is a very new language (currently even Github mislabels it as Modelica) so it keeps evolving with each release of Dfinity Canister SDK.

Remove everything from `src/crud/main.mo` and paste the following content:

```
import Array "mo:base/Array";
import Nat "mo:base/Nat";
import Option "mo:base/Option";
import Trie "mo:base/Trie";

actor Assistant {
    public type Id = Word32;
    private stable var next : Id = 0;

    // the datastructure to store the customers.
	private stable var customers : Trie.Trie<Id, Customer> = Trie.empty();	   
   
   type Customer = {        
        name: Text;
        address: Text;
        email:Text;    
    };

    type CustomerWithId = {  
        id: Id;      
        name: Text;
        address: Text;
        email:Text;    
    };

    // adds new customer to 
    public func addCustomer (newCustomer: Customer) : async Id {
        let id = next;
        next +%= 1;
        customers := Trie.replace(
            customers,
            key(id),
            eq,
            ?newCustomer,
        ).0;
        
        return id;
    };  

    public query func findAll () : async [CustomerWithId]  {
        let customersAsArray = Trie.toArray<Id, Customer, CustomerWithId>(customers, transform);
        return customersAsArray;
    };

    private func transform(id:Id, cust:Customer): CustomerWithId{
        let newCustomerWithId : CustomerWithId = {
            id = id; 
            name = cust.name;
            address =  cust.address;
            email = cust.email;
        };
        return newCustomerWithId;
    };
    
    private func eq(x : Id, y : Id) : Bool {
        return x == y;
    };

    private func key(x : Id) : Trie.Key<Id> {
        return { hash = x; key = x };
    };
};
```
We create an `actor` to contain our logic. To me an actor resembles a class. But it is not a class rather _ " it is like an object (and in Motoko, even looks like one), 
in that it encapsulates private state along with a set of methods to process 
messages that can be sent to it. But all message sends are asynchronous. 
Consequently, unlike conventional methods in OO, actor methods do not have results.
 Moreover, all messages are received sequentially by an actor—that is, 
 it has an implicit message queue and methods execute atomically,
  even when messages are sent concurrently.
Actors are a great model for concurrent programming because they automatically prevent race conditions (thanks to atomicity and encapsulated state) and deadlocks (because execution never blocks), and hence rule out many concurrency bugs." (Andreas Rossberg)_ 

Our actor has a public function `addCustomer`. It is public,  therefore we can call it from the frontend canister. This function adds (i.e. _saves_) an entry to <s>the database</s> the underlying datastructure which is a `Trie<Id, Customer>`.

The other public function queries our <s>database</s> persisting datastructure.
However there is one issue here; the best datastructure to store the customers and to lookup one individual customer by id is the `Trie<Id, Customer>` where the key is an `id` and the value is the `Customer`. Unfortunately the use of Trie proved difficult when I wanted to display all the customers on the frontend.  That's why I decided to convert (i.e. _flatten_) the `Trie<Id, Customer>` to an array of `CustomerWithId`. But I am new to motoko, and there is probably a better way to do it. Leave me a comment if you know a better solution.   

### Frontend

Create two files with the following names:
- components/Create.js
- components/Display.js

Create.js needs to have the following content:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import crud from 'ic:canisters/crud';

const Create = (props) => {

    const [pageTitle, setPageTitle] = useState('');
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
    const [address, setAddress] = useState('');
    const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
    const id = props.match.params.id;

    const changeNameHandler = (event) => {
        setName(event.target.value);
    }

    const changeAddressHandler = (event) => {
        setAddress(event.target.value);
    }

    const changeEmailHandler = (event) => {
        setEmail(event.target.value);
    }

    const saveOrUpdate = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        if (!name || !address || !email) {
            alert("Fill everything");
            return;
        }
        let customer = {
            name: name,
            address: address,
            email: email,
        };
        crud.addCustomer(customer).then((result) => {
            props.history.push('/customers');
        });
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h2 className="text-center">{pageTitle}</h2>

            < input name="name" placeholder=" Customers Name"
                value={name} onChange={changeNameHandler} />
            <input name="address" placeholder="Address"
                value={address} onChange={changeAddressHandler} />
            <input name="email" placeholder="Email"
                value={email} onChange={changeEmailHandler} />
            <button className="btn btn-success" onClick={saveOrUpdate}>Save</button>
        </div>
    )
}
export default Create
```
There are three input fields here and a button. The button calls the `saveorUpdate()` function. The function creates a `Customer` object and calls backend and passes the Customer as argument.

`Display.js` needs the following content:

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import crud from 'ic:canisters/crud';

const Display = (props) => {

    const [customers, setCustomers] = useState([]);
    useEffect(() => {
        loadCustomers();
    }, []);

    const loadCustomers = () => {
        crud.findAll().then((result) => {
            if (result) {
                setCustomers(result);
            }
        });
    }

    const addCustomer = (() => {
        props.history.push('/add/-1');
    });

    const editCustomer = ((id) => {
        console.log(id);
    });

    const deleteCustomer = ((id) => {
        console.log(id);
    });

    return (
        <div className="row">
            <div>
                <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={addCustomer}>
                    Add New Customer
                </button>
            </div>
            <h2 className="text-center">List of our Customers:</h2>

            <table className="table table-striped table-bordered">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Address</th>
                        <th>email</th>
                        <th>Actions</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                {<tbody>
                    {Object.entries(customers).map(
                        cust =>
                            <tr key={cust[1].id}>
                                <td>
                                    < input name="name" value={cust[1].name} type="text"
                                    />
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    < input name="address" value={cust[1].address} type="text"
                                    />
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    < input name="email" value={cust[1].email} type="text"
                                    />
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    <button onClick={() => editCustomer(cust[1].id)} className="btn btn-info">Update</button>
                                    <button onClick={() => deleteCustomer(cust[1].id)} className="btn btn-danger">Delete</button>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                    )}
                </tbody>
                }
            </table>
        </div>
    )
}
export default Display
```   
The hook `useEffect` with an empty array runs only when the component is loaded. It fetches the entries from backend.The entries are displayed as a table. There are two other functions `editCustomer` and `deleteCustomer` here, which we are going to implement later.

To take advantage of routing, replace the old content of `App.js` with this:
```js
import React from 'react';

import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Create from './components/Create';
import Display from './components/Display';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <BrowserRouter>
                <div className="container">
                    <Switch>
                        <Route path="/" exact component={Display}></Route>
                        <Route path="/customers" component={Display}></Route>
                        <Route path="/add/:id" component={Create}></Route>
                    </Switch>
                </div>
            </BrowserRouter>
        </div>
    );
}
export default App
```

Build and reinstall the application.
The add function should be ready to use.

## Adding Update and Delete functionality
### Backend

Add two more functions to the motoko file:

```
    public query func findCustomerById(id : Id) : async ?Customer {
        let result = Trie.find(customers, key(id), eq);
        return result;
    };

    //delete Customer if updatedCustomer is null. Otherwise update.  
    public func updateOrDelete(id : Id, updatedCustomer: ?Customer) : async Bool {
        let result = Trie.find(customers, key(id), eq);
        let exists = Option.isSome(result);
        if (exists) {
        customers := Trie.replace(
            customers,
            key(id),
            eq,
            updatedCustomer,
        ).0;
        };
        return exists;
    };
```

To update an existing Customer we fetch the old values associated with it. That's why we have `findCustomerById(id : Id)`. We provide an id and the function returns a Customer. On the frontend we use  these old values to fill the same input fields where we created a new entry. The function `updateOrDelete(...)` speaks for itself. If the second argument is a valid Customer, we update it. If it is null, we delete the Customer which belongs to the given id.  

### Frontend

Create another file with the name of `components/helper.js`. Its content should be the following:
```javascript
export const fromOptional = (optional) => {
    return optional.length > 0 ? optional[0] : null;
}

export const toOptional = (object) => {
    return object ? [object] : [];
}```

Both `Display.js` and `Create.js` needs to import the newly created file:
```
import { fromOptional, toOptional } from './helper';
```

`Create.js` needs an `useEffect`:
```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
        if (id == -1) {
            setPageTitle("Add new Customer");
            return;
        }
        setPageTitle("Edit existing Customer");
        crud.findCustomerById(parseInt(id)).then((result) => {
            let updatableCustomer = fromOptional(result);
            setName(updatableCustomer.name);
            setAddress(updatableCustomer.address);
            setEmail(updatableCustomer.email);
        });
    }, []);
```
The value of `id` is passed in the `props`:
```
const Create = (props) => {
    const id = props.match.params.id;
...
```
The `id` can be a positive number or `-1`.  If the `id` is `-1` we are just about to create a new Customer entry therefore there is nothing to fetch from backend. However if `id` is a positive number (i.e. a real id of an existing Customer) we need to call the backend for the old values to pre-fill the input fields. This is also the place to set the title of the page. For this we need to add the followings to the top of the div:
```javascript
 return (
        <div>
            <h2 className="text-center">{pageTitle}</h2>
``` 
To accomodate our changes the `saveOrUpdate` function needs to be updated to this:
 
```javascript
    const saveOrUpdate = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        if (!name || !address || !email) {
            alert("Fill everything");
            return;
        }
        let customer = {
            name: name,
            address: address,
            email: email,
        };
        if (id < 0) {
            crud.addCustomer(customer).then((result) => {
                props.history.push('/customers');
            });
        } else {
            crud.updateOrDelete(parseInt(id), toOptional(customer)).then((r) => {
                props.history.push('/customers');
            });
        }
    }
```
Again, everything depends on the id. If the id is `<0` (i.e. `-1`) we call the function which creates a new entry. Otherwise we call the update function.

Whether the `id` is `-1` or not is decided in `Display.js`. If we edit an existing one we just forward its `id` like this. Add the following Snippet to `Display.js`:
```javascript
   const editCustomer = ((id) => {
        props.history.push(`/add/${id}`);
    });
```

We also need to implement the delete functionality. Add the following snippet:

```javascript
  const deleteCustomer = ((id) => {
        crud.updateOrDelete(parseInt(id), toOptional(null)).then((result) => {
            if (result) {
                loadCustomers();
            }
        });
    });
```

Build and reinstall as usual. The application should run like this:
