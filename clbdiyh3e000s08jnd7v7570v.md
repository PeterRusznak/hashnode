# OpenAI's ChatGPT is beyond amazing.. but it is also quite scary.

Last week, OpenAI, a leading research institute focused on artificial intelligence technology, announced that it was opening public access to its latest product - an AI Chatbot. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a large language model based on the popular GPT-3 model, an AI tool that allows users to engage with it in a conversation-style dialogue and answers any queries posed by users. 

Quite a few people find it interesting:

Among ordinary folks like me, there are also some well-known guys to voice their opinion:

It is scary good indeed, and way beyond my personal expectation. 

### Asking not-so-trivial questions

Yesterday I was under the impression it is just another chatbot, or a (very) advanced autocomplete. I threw a bunch of silly questions (questions that are complex and twisted therefore you would not ask from a computer) and the result were always meaningful and intelligent.

Convincing, one can only agree with it:

![joly_well_2.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670412997943/QrTYqwIrt.png align="left")

Brilliant explanation, outstanding logic:
![jolly_well_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670412985144/u8BDBNH_J.png align="left")

Quite informative answer to an odd question:
![jolly_well.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670412942268/8iswpaIUN.png align="left")

Logic is there, only the last step is missing:
![passport.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670503320049/_jxhz2RsO.png align="left")

And it looks quite resistant to spreading misinformation:
![italy.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670570822236/Zu2qK5zjl.png align="left")

Anyone, who ever had the displeasure of talking to the poorly trained chatbots common on commercial sites can easily attest that the examples above are fundamentally better at mimicking an intelligent conversation.  
But this is only the tip of the iceberg. 

### Generating poetry and stories

You can literally generate poems:
  

![bitcoin.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670404507280/m_Yx06SWz.png align="left")

Or short romantic stories:

![Judit_vlasz.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670405412419/G4_S_x4by.png align="left")

I even managed to freak it out, by ordering a horror story:


![santa.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670492394154/m1uPdLU5P.png align="left")

### A decision-making device

Apart from generating stories it can also give you pros and cons if you need to make decisions:

![BJJ_pro.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670405956214/68jPhAY4i.png align="left")

I only added **'not'** to discourage me practicing bjj:

![bjj_con.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406141863/z9vEYsEJE.png align="left")

### Generating code

It can even generate code:

![fibo.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406524124/hZZFVItCZ.png align="left")


![fibo_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406566987/9qposq62K.png align="left")

I can be more precise with the requirements and limitations. Here I prefer recursion:

![rec.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406870813/Lw_agZoJ8.png align="left")

Of course, python is not the only language:
![javascript.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407049133/iBj_soJ1k.png align="left")

The code is not commented in this case  but it nevertheless comes with explanation:

![no_com.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407204583/JfJRIwT1b.png align="left")

### Availibility in other languages and translations

It is also available in German:
![German.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670409432642/dK5dzCNb0.png align="left")

Trying it in Hungarian resulted strange results. On one hand it completely understood my question and generated a completely intelligent answer. However this answer was not in Hungarian, but in German:

![magyarul.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670409670427/P16aSbbpY.png align="left")

By the way languages and translation. It can even make google translate obsolete. As a native Hungarian speaker I can attest that below translations are perfect:
![ford_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670502197544/5u5ui76lF.png align="left")

![ford_2.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670502207478/d_QqqARS5.png align="left")

### Limitations

However it does not provide personal advice:

![merr_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407765754/4k2gdnz0L.png align="left")

Neither does it generate visual outputs:

![draw.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670408251388/bM4nu0idN.png align="left")

This is bit disappointing and relieving at the same time:

### Summary
To summarize I am not sure to be more excited or scared. Probably the latter. On the plus side, pair programming with this can be very convenient. I guess it can very much substitute stackoverflow.

But everyone knows the phenomenon, that if you express some interest about anything online, relevant ads will haunt you for weeks if not months. In the future an advanced form of this AI will generate a text, a tailor-made, personalized story for you about the object, service you searched for. Then another AI will read this story and generate a film based on it. You'll be bombarded with AI-generated, very realistic clips, if not entire films featuring you using/enjoying the thing you searched for. 

But unfortunately there are even more possible negative side-effects.
Not only that no kids  need to be writing homework ever again but this kind of stuff can also make a lot of people redundant, including software developers. Obviously having the ability to generate the code examples above is [not (yet) enough to substitute a software engineer](https://www.theblock.co/post/192514/ethereum-vitalik-buterin-says-chatgpt-far-from-replacing-humans) as this role requires a lot of background information - but it is definitely a good starting point. Marketing people have also a lot to lose. Something similar happened already to translators:

![tranlate.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670437449283/tToECYDiX.png align="left")

My biggest worry however is if the public has access to this kind of advanced technology, you can only guess what the military can already possess.. lets's pray that people are responsible and know what they are doing.

Finally, here is what more knowledgeable people say:

![eleizer.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670423324407/jiX1VuE1F.png align="left")

Well, I don't really like the last sentence, even if it is only meant to be a joke. 

Let's finish with this:
