# OpenAI's ChatGPT is beyond amazing.. but it is also quite scary.

If you have anything to do with computers, you can't miss [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

It is scary good indeed, and way beyond my personal expectation.

Yesterday I was under the impression it is just another chatbot, or a (very) advanced autocomplete. I threw a bunch of silly questions (questions that are complex and twisted therefore you would not ask from a computer) and the result were always meaningful and intelligent.

Some example of the solid manifestation of great explanation and logic:

But it was only the tip of the iceberg. You can literally generate poems:

Or short romantic stories:

It can very well give you pros and cons if you need to make decisions:

I only added **'not'** to discourage me practicing bjj:


![bjj_con.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406141863/z9vEYsEJE.png align="left")

It can even generate code:

I can be more precise with the requirements and limitations. Here I prefer recursion:



![rec.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406870813/Lw_agZoJ8.png align="left")

Of course, python is not the only language:
![javascript.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407049133/iBj_soJ1k.png align="left")

The code is not commented in this case  but it nevertheless comes with explanation:

![no_com.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407204583/JfJRIwT1b.png align="left")

However it does not provide personal advice:

![merr_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407765754/4k2gdnz0L.png align="left")

In this case even persistence fails (second, third, etc attempt): 

![mer_2.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407886088/6fqFLx1q0.png align="left")


Neither does it generate visual outputs:

![draw.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670408251388/bM4nu0idN.png align="left")

This is bit disappointing and relieving at the same time:

![big_num.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670409210093/zi1FIkCEJ.png align="left")

It is also available in German:
![German.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670409432642/dK5dzCNb0.png align="left")

Trying it in Hungarian resulted strange results. On one hand it completely understood my question and generated a completely intelligent answer. However this answer was not in Hungarian, but in German. First attempt:

![magyarul.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670409670427/P16aSbbpY.png align="left")

Mixed language for the second attempt, too:

To summarize I am not sure to be excited or scared. Probably the latter. Not only that no kids  needs to be writing homework ever again but this kind of stuff can also make a lot of people redundant, including software developers. Not to mention if the public has access to this kind of advanced technology, you can only guess what the military can already possess.. lets's pray that people are responsible and know what they are doing..
