# OpenAI's ChatGPT is beyond amazing.. but it is also quite scary.

If you have anything to do with computers, you can't miss [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

Quite a few people find it interesting:

Among ordinary folks like me, there are also some well-known guys to voice their opinion:

It is scary good indeed, and way beyond my personal expectation. 

Yesterday I was under the impression it is just another chatbot, or a (very) advanced autocomplete. I threw a bunch of silly questions (questions that are complex and twisted therefore you would not ask from a computer) and the result were always meaningful and intelligent.

Convincing, one can only agree with it:

Brilliant explanation, outstanding logic:

Quite informative answer to an odd question:

Anyone, who ever had the displeasure of talking to the poorly trained chatbots common on commercial sites can easily attest that the examples above are fundamentally better at mimicking an intelligent conversation.  
But this is only the tip of the iceberg. You can literally generate poems:

Or short romantic stories:

I even managed to freak it out, by ordering a horror-story:
![freak_out.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670414914609/J4arblGM2.png align="left")

Minor remark: *"set sail from Cirkewwa, bound for the island of Malta." *is incorrect. Cirkewwa is on the main Maltese island (Malta). Departing from Cirkewwa and heading to Malta makes no sense in real life.




Apart from generating stories it can also give you pros and cons if you need to make decisions:

![BJJ_pro.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670405956214/68jPhAY4i.png align="left")

I only added **'not'** to discourage me practicing bjj:


![bjj_con.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406141863/z9vEYsEJE.png align="left")

It can even generate code:


![fibo.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406524124/hZZFVItCZ.png align="left")


![fibo_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406566987/9qposq62K.png align="left")

I can be more precise with the requirements and limitations. Here I prefer recursion:



![rec.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670406870813/Lw_agZoJ8.png align="left")

Of course, python is not the only language:
![javascript.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407049133/iBj_soJ1k.png align="left")

The code is not commented in this case  but it nevertheless comes with explanation:

![no_com.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407204583/JfJRIwT1b.png align="left")

However it does not provide personal advice:

![merr_1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670407765754/4k2gdnz0L.png align="left")

Neither does it generate visual outputs:

![draw.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670408251388/bM4nu0idN.png align="left")

This is bit disappointing and relieving at the same time:

![big_num.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670409210093/zi1FIkCEJ.png align="left")

It is also available in German:
![German.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670409432642/dK5dzCNb0.png align="left")

Trying it in Hungarian resulted strange results. On one hand it completely understood my question and generated a completely intelligent answer. However this answer was not in Hungarian, but in German:

![magyarul.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670409670427/P16aSbbpY.png align="left")

To summarize I am not sure to be excited or scared. Probably the latter. Not only that no kids  need to be writing homework ever again but this kind of stuff can also make a lot of people redundant, including software developers. Obviously having the ability to generate the code examples above is not (yet) enough to substitute a software engineer as this role requires a lot of background information - but it is definitely a good starting point. Marketing people have also a lot to lose. Something similar happened already to translators:

![tranlate.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670437449283/tToECYDiX.png align="left")

My biggest worry however is if the public has access to this kind of advanced technology, you can only guess what the military can already possess.. lets's pray that people are responsible and know what they are doing.

Finally, here is what more knowledgeable people say:

Well, I don't really like the last sentence, even if it is only meant to be a joke.
